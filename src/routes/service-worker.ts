 *
 * The service-worker.ts file is used to have state of the art prefetching.
 * https://qwik.dev/qwikcity/prefetching/overview/

 * Qwik uses a service worker to speed up your site and reduce latency, ie, not used in the traditional way of offline.
 * You can also use this file to add more functionality that runs in the service worker.
